## Unlocking Versatility: Python's Solutions Across a Spectrum of Problems
- Python can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including automation tasks.
- For example, you can use Python to create an EC2 instance on AWS.
- While tools like Terraform exist for similar purposes, the goal here is not just deploying the server but understanding Python as a versatile programming language.
- Starting with simple logic, Python's capabilities extend beyond what tools like Terraform offer, allowing for a broader range of solutions to various problems.

## Task - Creating an EC2 Instance on AWS with Python: A Systematic Approach

### Determining Business Logic Requirements:
- Identify the necessary inputs for creating an EC2 instance, such as the AWS region, chosen AMI, and key pair.
- The business logic embedded in the EC2 creation code defines the specific data input requirements.

#### 1. Understanding Input Formats:
- Examine the expected formats for inputs, considering variations like int, string, and float.
- Begin the process by focusing on the business logic to discern the required input formats.

#### 2. Data Conversion for Consistency:
- Implement data conversion mechanisms to ensure that the supplied inputs align with the expected formats.
- This step bridges the gap between user input variations and the uniform requirements of the business logic.

#### 3. Implementation of Business Logic:
- Develop the Python code that encapsulates the business logic for creating the EC2 server.
- Utilize the identified input requirements and converted data to execute the logic seamlessly.

#### 4. Execution and Output Generation:
- Execute the Python code to initiate the creation of the EC2 instance on AWS.
- Observe the output phase, generating the desired outcome based on the provided inputs and the executed business logic.

## Developing Business Logic for EC2 Instance Creation in Python with Boto3
- To write the business logic for creating an EC2 instance in Python, leverage the Boto3 moduleâ€”a dedicated AWS library.
- Boto3 simplifies AWS infrastructure operations using Python.
- Follow the provided links for Python modules understanding (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) and AWS Boto3 documentation (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

## Using the Boto3 Module: Installation and Quickstart
- To utilize the Boto3 module, it must be installed manually using the package manager, pip3.
- Boto3, designed by AWS for automation purposes, is not included in default Python installations.
- Follow the installation guide at https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#installation for seamless integration.
- Use the command ```pip3 install boto3``` for Python 3 compatibility; while some documentation may refer to pip alone, it is intended for Python 2 compatibility.
  
## Using Boto3 with Amazon Linux: A Quick Guide
- To employ the Boto3 module on Amazon Linux:
#### Check Python Version
```
python3 --version
```
#### Install Pip
```
curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py --user
```
#### Install Boto3
```
pip3 install boto3
```
#### Configuring AWS Credentials
- Run the following command to configure your AWS credentials:
```
aws configure
```
- Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format.

#### Invoke Python Interpreter
```
python3
```
#### Import Boto3
```
import boto3
```

#### Explore Boto3 Documentation:
- Boto3 Quickstart - https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#using-boto3
- Boto3 Services Reference - https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/index.html

#### Operate on EC2
- Collect EC2 functions into a variable:
```
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='us-east-1')
```
- In this line, we create a variable named ec2 and assign it the EC2 client object obtained from Boto3.
- The boto3.client() function is used to create an EC2 client. It takes the service name ('ec2') and an optional parameter region_name specifying the AWS region. Here, we've set it to 'us-east-1'.
- The ec2 variable now holds the necessary functionalities to interact with EC2 services in the specified region.

#### Run EC2 Instances
```
response = ec2.run_instances(ImageId="ami-079db87dc4c10ac91", InstanceType="t2.micro", KeyName='python', MaxCount=1, MinCount=1)    # Change your image id, required instance type, KeyName
```
- This line uses the run_instances method of the ec2 object to launch EC2 instances.
- The method takes various parameters, such as ImageId (the Amazon Machine Image ID), InstanceType (the type of instance, e.g., 't2.micro'), KeyName (the name of the key pair), MaxCount, and MinCount.
- The response variable stores the output of the run_instances method, including information about the launched instances.

#### Display Output
```
print(response)
```
- The print() function is used to display the output stored in the response variable.
- The output is typically in JSON format and contains details about the newly launched EC2 instances, such as instance IDs, public IP addresses, and more.

## Writing Dynamic and User-Interactive EC2 Creation Script

- Create a file named ```create_ec2.py``` and input the following code:

```
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='us-east-1')   # Specify your region
ec2.run_instances(ImageId="ami-079db87dc4c10ac91",InstanceType="t2.micro",KeyName='python',MaxCount=1,MinCount=1) # Specify your ImageId, InstanceType, KeyName
print(response)
```

- To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 create_ec2.py
```

### Requirement is to write the script to avoid hardcoding values by utilizing variables.

```
import boto3 

# Create an EC2 client in the 'us-east-1' region
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='us-east-1')

# Specify values using variables
ami = "ami-079db87dc4c10ac91"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
key_name = "python"
max_count = "1"
min_count = "1"

# Run EC2 instances with data conversion
response = ec2.run_instances(
    ImageId=ami,
    InstanceType=instance_type,
    KeyName=key_name,
    MaxCount=int(max_count),
    MinCount=int(min_count)
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```
- In this script, values such as AMI ID, instance type, key name, max count, and min count are stored in variables, allowing for easier modification. The int() function is used for data conversion to ensure that max_count and min_count are treated as integers when passed to the run_instances method.


- To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 create_ec2.py
```

### Requirement is to write the script dynamically involves users by prompting input, allowing flexible configuration.

```
import boto3 

# Create an EC2 client in the 'us-east-1' region
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='us-east-1')

# Specify values with user input
ami = "ami-079db87dc4c10ac91"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
key_name = "python"
max_count = input("Specify max count: ")
min_count = input("Specify min count: ")

# Run EC2 instances with data conversion
response = ec2.run_instances(
    ImageId=ami,
    InstanceType=instance_type,
    KeyName=key_name,
    MaxCount=int(max_count),
    MinCount=int(min_count)
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```
- To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 create_ec2.py
```

## Task - Stop an EC2 Instance on AWS with Python
- Create a file named ```stop_ec2.py``` and input the following code:
```
import boto3 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")
response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=['i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501',],)
print (response)  
```

- To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 stop_ec2.py
```

### Requirement is to write the script stops the specified EC2 instance and outputs a one-liner confirming the successful operation.

```
import boto3 
id = "i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501"
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")
response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[id,],)
print ("Instance Id: {} is rebooted".format(id)) 
```
- To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 stop_ec2.py
```

- output: ```Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is rebooted```

### Requirement is to write the script prompts the user to enter the instance ID of the EC2 server they wish to stop:

```
import boto3 

# Prompt the user to enter the instance ID
instance_id_to_stop = input("Enter instance id you want to stop: ")

# Create an EC2 client in the 'us-east-1' region
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='us-east-1')

# Stop the specified EC2 instance
response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id_to_stop,],)

# Print a one-liner confirmation
print ("Instance Id: {} is rebooted".format(instance_id_to_stop)) 
```
- To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 stop_ec2.py
```

## Brainstorming
### Use Case
In a cloud environment, you have a hundred AWS security groups (SGs) managing access controls for various resources. Your security policy dictates that no SG should allow public access to port 22 (SSH) for enhanced security. While Terraform was used for the initial deployment, it lacks the capability to actively manage and enforce security policies post-deployment.

### Solution:
- To address this challenge, you decide to leverage Python and Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. You develop a custom Python script that iterates through all existing SGs, checks if port 22 is open to the public, and deletes non-compliant SGs. This script acts as a dynamic and proactive security enforcer, ensuring that your AWS environment adheres to the specified security standards.
- The Python script provides the flexibility to adapt to evolving security requirements and actively manage existing resources. Unlike Terraform, which excels in deploying infrastructure but falls short in ongoing resource management, Python empowers you to implement custom logic and enforce security policies dynamically. This use case showcases the agility and control Python brings to the management of security groups in your AWS environment.
