## Navigating Python Syntax and Automation with Boto3 in AWS

- Learning a programming or scripting language involves grasping its syntax, followed by utilizing that understanding to construct practical use cases.
- In Python, the focus is on employing syntax for automation, particularly with common modules like boto3 for interaction with AWS services.
- Emphasizing four key points—Data Input, Data Transformation, Business Logic, and Output—is crucial in scripting.

## Task - Create two EC2 instances using Boto3 in Python. 

- Create a file named ```main.py``` 
```
import boto3 

# Create an EC2 client in the 'us-east-1' region
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='us-east-1')

# Specify values using variables
ami = "ami-079db87dc4c10ac91"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
key_name = "python"
max_count = "1"
min_count = "1"

# Run EC2 instances with data conversion
response = ec2.run_instances(
    ImageId=ami,
    InstanceType=instance_type,
    KeyName=key_name,
    MaxCount=int(max_count),
    MinCount=int(min_count)
)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```
This will create the first server.

```
python3 main.py
```
This will create one more server.


## Now the current requirement is to stop two specific servers.

```
# Module section 
import boto3 
id1 = "i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501"
id2 = "i-09a4c85aac734a40e"
# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")
# Stop Business Logic 
response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[id1,],)
response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[id2,],)
# Stop response Output 
print ("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(id1))
print ("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(id2))  
```

To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```
- Output
```
Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is stopped 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is stopped
```

## Now the current requirement is to start two specific servers.

```
# Module section 
import boto3 
id1 = "i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501"
id2 = "i-09a4c85aac734a40e"
# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Start Business Logic 
response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[id1,],)
response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[id2,],)

# Start response Output 
print ("Instance Id: {} is started".format(id1))
print ("Instance Id: {} is started".format(id2))  
```

To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```
- Output
```
Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is started
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is started
```
## Now the current requirement is to stop and start two specific servers.

```
# Module section 
import boto3 
id1 = "i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501"
id2 = "i-09a4c85aac734a40e"
# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Stop Business Logic 
response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[id1,],)
response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[id2,],)

# Stop response Output 
print ("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(id1))
print ("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(id2))  

# Start Business Logic 
response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[id1,],)
response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[id2,],)

# Start response Output 
print ("Instance Id: {} is started".format(id1))
print ("Instance Id: {} is started".format(id2))
```
To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```
- Output
```
Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is stopped 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is stopped

Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is started 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is started
```

## Now the requirement is to avoid using separate variables for two instance IDs to minimize memory consumption during runtime. 
- In Python, it is preferred to store multiple instance IDs in a single list variable, leveraging the list data type, which allows values to be grouped within square brackets, each separated by a comma; this is analogous to the exploration of integer, string, and float data types.

```
# Module section 
import boto3 

# List of instance IDs
instance_ids = ["i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501", "i-09a4c85aac734a40e"]

# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Stop Business Logic 
response_stop_1 = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_ids[0]])
response_stop_2 = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_ids[1]])

# Stop response Output 
print("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(instance_ids[0]))
print("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(instance_ids[1]))

# Start Business Logic 
response_start_1 = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_ids[0]])
response_start_2 = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_ids[1]])

# Start response Output 
print("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_ids[0]))
print("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_ids[1]))
```
To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```

- Output
```
Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is stopped 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is stopped

Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is started 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is started
```

## Now the requirement is to use a dictionary instead of a list to store instance IDs

```
# Module section 
import boto3 

# Dictionary of instance IDs
instance_id = {'id1': 'i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501', 'id2': 'i-09a4c85aac734a40e'}

# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Stop Business Logic 
response_stop_1 = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id['id1']])
response_stop_2 = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id['id2']])

# Stop response Output 
print("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(instance_id['id1']))
print("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(instance_id['id2']))

# Start Business Logic 
response_start_1 = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id['id1']])
response_start_2 = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id['id2']])

# Start response Output 
print("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_id['id1']))
print("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_id['id2']))
```
To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```

- Output
```
Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is stopped 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is stopped

Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is started 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is started
```

## Let's go through the examples step by step

```
# Open Python interpreter
python3

# List Examples
a = [4, 7, "Pavan"]
print(a)        # Output: [4, 7, 'Pavan']
print(a[0])     # Output: 4
print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'list'>
print(type(a[2]))  # Output: <class 'str'>
print(len(a))   # Output: 3

a.append(10)
print(a)        # Output: [4, 7, 'Pavan', 10]

a.pop(1)
print(a)        # Output: [4, 'Pavan', 10]

a.clear()
print(a)        # Output: []

a = [21, 12, 1, 9]
a.sort()
print(a)        # Output: [1, 9, 12, 21]

a.insert(2, 15)
print(a)        # Output: [1, 9, 15, 12, 21]

# String Examples
a = "python"
b = a
print(a)        # Output: python
print(b)        # Output: python
print(a[0])     # Output: p

a = "python for DevOps"
a.split()
# Output: ['python', 'for', 'DevOps']

# Exercise
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
a.append(4)
print(a)        # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(b)        # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

exit()
```

## Let's explore variables in Python 

- In Python, variables can be categorized into Mutable and Immutable types.

### Immutable Variables:
- Immutable variables, such as integers and strings, operate in a way where the value stored in a specific memory address is unchangeable.
- When you assign a variable a to a value, say a = 10, Python stores the value '10' in a memory location with a unique address.
- If you create another variable b and set it equal to a with b = a, Python creates a new memory location for b and copies the value '10' into that location.
- If you then modify a to a = 15, Python creates a new memory location for the updated value '15' and associates a with this new address, leaving the original memory location for '10' intact.
- This characteristic of immutable variables ensures that modifying the value creates a new memory address rather than altering the existing one.

### Mutable Variables:
- Mutable variables, such as lists and dictionaries, behave differently.
- When you create a list, for example, a = [1, 2, 3], Python allocates a memory address for the list and stores the values there.
- If you then assign another variable b to a with b = a, both a and b reference the same memory address where the list [1, 2, 3] is stored.
- Any changes made to the list, such as appending or modifying values, occur within the same memory address, making the variable mutable.
- This means that if you modify the list through a, the changes are reflected when accessing the list through b. This behavior is characteristic of mutable variables.

#### Remember - An essential principle for effective coding is to minimize code duplication by ensuring that repeated lines are consolidated into unique, reusable structures, promoting better maintainability and reducing the overall number of lines in your code.

## Let's introduce loops
- Introducing loops is essential in programming for efficiently performing repetitive tasks with varying values, ensuring a concise and reusable approach.
- Let's break down the code and execute the individual sections.

### Stop Business Logic
```
# Module section 
import boto3 

# Dictionary of instance IDs
instance_id = {'id1': 'i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501', 'id2': 'i-09a4c85aac734a40e'}

# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Stop Business Logic
for i in instance_id:
    response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
    print("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(instance_id[i]))
```

To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```

- Output
```
Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is stopped 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is stopped
```
### Start Business Logic 
```
# Module section 
import boto3 

# Dictionary of instance IDs
instance_id = {'id1': 'i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501', 'id2': 'i-09a4c85aac734a40e'}

# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

for i in instance_id:
    response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
    print("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_id[i]))
```


To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```

- Output
```
Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is started 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is started
```

## Let's introduce Functions
- To facilitate toggling between starting and stopping instances, the concept of functions has been applied. By commenting out either the start or stop function as needed, users can seamlessly control the execution of the corresponding business logic, illustrating the practical application of functions in this context.


```
# Module section 
import boto3 

# Dictionary of instance IDs
instance_id = {'id1': 'i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501', 'id2': 'i-09a4c85aac734a40e'}

# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Stop Business Logic 
def stop(): 
    for i in instance_id:
        response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
        print("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(instance_id[i]))

# Start Business Logic 
def start():
    for i in instance_id: 
        response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
        print("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_id[i]))

# Call the stop function
stop()
```
- In this code, the stop() function is invoked, and it will stop the instances defined in the instance_id dictionary. You can similarly call the start() function to start the instances.

To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```

- Output
```
Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is stopped 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is stopped
```

### Code with the start() function call included:

```
# Module section 
import boto3 

# Dictionary of instance IDs
instance_id = {'id1': 'i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501', 'id2': 'i-09a4c85aac734a40e'}

# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Stop Business Logic 
def stop(): 
    for i in instance_id:
        response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
        print("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(instance_id[i]))

## Start Business Logic 
def start():
    for i in instance_id: 
        response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
        print("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_id[i]))

# Call the start function
start()
```

To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```

- Output
```
Instance Id: i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501 is started 
Instance Id: i-09a4c85aac734a40e is started
```

- Note - In the given code, the execution of the start() function proceeds independently of the success or failure of the preceding stop() function. The code does not validate or respond to the actual outcome of the stop() operation, and it simply continues to execute the start() function, printing standard messages for each instance.

```
# Module section 
import boto3 

# Dictionary of instance IDs
instance_id = {'id1': 'i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501', 'id2': 'i-09a4c85aac734a40e'}

# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Stop Business Logic 
def stop(): 
    for i in instance_id:
        response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
        print(response)

# Start Business Logic 
def start():
    for i in instance_id: 
        response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
        print("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_id[i]))

# Call the stop function
stop()
```
- When you run this script using python3 main.py, it will print the response in JSON format for each instance stop operation.

## Data parsing in Python using a JSON response:
Below is a simple example demonstrating data parsing in Python using a JSON response:
```
# Sample JSON response (replace this with your actual JSON data)
sample_json_response = {
    "ResponseMetadata": {
        "HTTPStatusCode": 200,
        # other metadata fields...
    },
    # other data...
}

# Take the response into a variable
a = sample_json_response

# See what type of data
print(type(a))

# Access the 'ResponseMetadata' dictionary
response_metadata = a.get('ResponseMetadata', {})

# In this example, interested in the HTTPS response code
http_status_code = response_metadata.get('HTTPStatusCode', None)

# Print the obtained data
print("Response Metadata:", response_metadata)
print("HTTP Status Code:", http_status_code)
```

- Replace sample_json_response with the actual JSON data you receive. This example illustrates accessing nested fields in a JSON structure and printing specific information.

## Below is the code that includes error handling for both stopping and starting instances based on the HTTP status code in the response:

```
# Module section 
import boto3 

# Dictionary of instance IDs
instance_id = {'id1': 'i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501', 'id2': 'i-09a4c85aac734a40e'}

# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Stop Business Logic 
def stop(): 
    for i in instance_id: 
        response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
        if response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'] == 200:
            print("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(instance_id[i]))
        else:
            print("Failed to stop the instance Id: {}".format(instance_id[i]))

# Start Business Logic 
def start():
    for i in instance_id: 
        response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i]])
        if response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'] == 200:
            print("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_id[i]))
        else:
            print("Failed to start the instance Id: {}".format(instance_id[i]))

# Call the stop function
stop()

# Call the start function
start()
```
- This code checks the HTTP status code in the response and prints a success or failure message accordingly for both stopping and starting instances.

## Now the requirement is not to use 2 functions and make it into 1 function only

```
# Module section 
import boto3 
instance_id = { 'id1':'i-0afeb7ab7d9f67501', 'id2':'i-09a4c85aac734a40e' }
# boto3 client 
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name="us-east-1")

# Combined Business Logic 
def instance_state(state):
    for i in instance_id:
        if state == "stop":
            response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i],],)
            if response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode'] == 200:
                print ("Instance Id: {} is stopped".format(instance_id[i]))
            else:
                print ("Failed to stop the instance Id: {}".format(instance_id[i]))
        elif state == "start":
            response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id[i],],)
            print ("Instance Id: {} is started".format(instance_id[i]))
        else:
            print ("Invalid state. Please choose 'start' or 'stop'.")

# User input for state
state = input ("Please choose start or stop: ")
instance_state(state)    # call the function 
```

To execute the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```
- Once you execute it prompts the below message
##### Please choose start or stop:
